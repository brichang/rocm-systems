# Tests the ci_images jq in .github/workflows/hipfile-ci-toplevel.yml
# (Precheck job -> "Compute CI image names" step). ci_images consumes
# full_CI_images_matrix.include and emits the keyed map of image names
# used by downstream jobs. This script covers the same 12 scenarios as
# test-full-ci-images-matrix.sh to confirm both stay in sync.
#
# The functions `compute_full_ci_images_matrix` and
# `compute_ci_images_refactored` are verbatim copies of the workflow's
# jq. If you edit either, mirror the change here and re-run.
#
# Usage: bash projects/hipfile/util/test-ci-images.sh
#
set -uo pipefail  # not -e: keep going on failures

# Reference implementation of full_CI_images_matrix (verbatim from the workflow).
